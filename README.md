# MovieList-App
MovieList App was created for purpose of learning Java, JavaFx, FXML and MySQL. This app can arrange your movie and series schedule 
into the databse and then you divide them into watched, watching and to watch sections. So your list will be more clear and more readable.

## Getting Started

If you want to use this program, you have to download all files of this repository, Java JDK, JavaFX, MYSQL Community and MYSQL connector.
Then you have to go to MySQL.java in src folder and configure "Connection conn" variable to your own database data like password, login.
After that you must import .sql file to your datatabase to make tables with movie and series list. If you make this, you will be able to run application.
